/**
 * Ray - Represents a ray in 3D space.
 *
 * A ray is like a laser beam: it starts at a point and goes in a direction forever.
 *
 * Defined by the equation from the slides:
 *     P(t) = O + t * D
 *
 * Where:
 *   - O = origin (where the ray starts)
 *   - D = direction (which way it's pointing)
 *   - t = parameter (how far along the ray). t=0 is the origin, t=1 is one "D-length" away
 *   - P(t) = the resulting point on the ray at distance t
 *
 * Example:
 *   Origin = (0, 0, 0), Direction = (1, 0, 0)
 *   t=0  → P = (0,0,0)  (at the origin)
 *   t=1  → P = (1,0,0)  (1 unit to the right)
 *   t=5  → P = (5,0,0)  (5 units to the right)
 *   t=-1 → P = (-1,0,0) (behind the origin — usually we ignore t < 0)
