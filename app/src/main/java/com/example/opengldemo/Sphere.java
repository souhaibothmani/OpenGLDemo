     * INTERSECT - Tests if a ray hits this sphere and returns the t values.
     *
     * This implements the quadratic formula from slide 2:
     *
     * Step 1: Substitute ray equation P(t) = O + tD into sphere equation |P - C|² = R²
     *         → |(O + tD) - C|² = R²
     *
     * Step 2: Rearrange into quadratic form: at² + bt + c = 0
     *         where:
     *           L = O - C          (vector from sphere center to ray origin)
     *           a = D · D          (always positive, = 1 if direction is normalized)
     *           b = 2 * (L · D)    (how aligned the ray is with the center-to-origin vector)
     *           c = L · L - R²     (squared distance from origin to center, minus radius²)
     *
     * Step 3: Solve with quadratic formula: t = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
     *
     * The DISCRIMINANT (Δ = b² - 4ac) tells us how many intersections:
     *   - Δ < 0 → NO intersection (ray misses the sphere entirely)
     *   - Δ = 0 → ONE intersection (ray grazes the sphere tangentially)
     *   - Δ > 0 → TWO intersections (ray enters and exits the sphere)
     *                t1 = entry point, t2 = exit point
     *
     * @param ray the ray to test against this sphere
     * @return float array with t values [t1, t2] if hit, or null if no intersection.
     *         t1 is always the closer (entry) point, t2 the farther (exit) point.
     *         If t1 < 0, the intersection is behind the ray origin.
