 * AABB - Axis-Aligned Bounding Box.
 *
 * A 3D box whose edges are aligned with the X, Y, Z axes (no rotation).
 * Defined by just two corners:
 *   - min: the corner with the smallest x, y, z values
 *   - max: the corner with the largest x, y, z values
 *
 * Think of it like a shoebox sitting straight on a table — no tilting.
 *
 * Uses the SLAB METHOD from slide 3 for ray intersection.

     * INTERSECT - Tests if a ray hits this box using the Slab Method (slide 3).
     *
     * The idea is simple:
     * The box is the OVERLAP of 3 "slabs" (one per axis).
     * A slab is just the space between two parallel planes.
     *   - X slab: between x = min.x and x = max.x
     *   - Y slab: between y = min.y and y = max.y
     *   - Z slab: between z = min.z and z = max.z
     *
     * For each axis, we find WHEN (at what t) the ray enters and exits that slab.
     * Then we check if all three intervals overlap.
     *
     * Steps:
     *   1. For each axis: compute tMin and tMax (entry and exit t values)
     *   2. tEnter = max(tXmin, tYmin, tZmin)  → latest entry across all axes
     *   3. tExit  = min(tXmax, tYmax, tZmax)  → earliest exit across all axes
     *   4. If tEnter <= tExit → HIT (the intervals overlap)
     *      If tEnter >  tExit → MISS (the ray passes outside the box)
     *
     * @param ray the ray to test
     * @return float array [tEnter, tExit] if hit, null if miss
